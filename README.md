# README

To run this project - please follow below steps:

* `bundle install`

* `rails db:create`

* `rails db:migrate`

* `rails tailwindcss:build`

* Finally to start the server - run - `./bin/dev`


* I haven't completed the employment details modal part in this as I am still learning stimulus js

* I have used `FactoryBot` instead of `Faker` - I understand that faker is used for generating dummy data but I don't have any such usecase in this application - hence not used.
